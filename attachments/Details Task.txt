Notes:
Designs and layout of all screens are attached except the product details page, as no design is required for it, just display the title of the selected product on it.
feel free to use any dummy images or text for the sliding introduction pages, app icon & splash screen.
No functionality is required for cart, search, filter nor sort by, just build them in the UI as per the attached designs, but don't implement their functionality.
